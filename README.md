# Airport Management System

The Airport Management System is a web application developed in Java, using Apache Tomcat as the server, and JSP for the frontend. This application facilitates the management of flights, runways, and gates, providing real-time updates to users and allowing administrators to create and manage flight schedules.

- **Flight Management**: Admins can create and manage flight schedules.
- **Runway and Gate Scheduling**: Admins can pre-schedule runway and gate assignments.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Users receive real-time updates on flight statuses.
- **Admin Panel**: A secured admin panel for flight creation and scheduling.
- **Ticket Reservation**: Users can reserve tickets and view flight information after flight schedules are created by the admin.

## Prerequisites
